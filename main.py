# Example puzzle: herbalists (possibly unsolvable)

# qualities
# names: Antonius, Domingo, Flavian, Horacio, Lucius
#           a1        a2        a3      a4      a5
# herbs: mandrake root, cinquefoil, rosemary, juniper berries, mistletoe
#           b1              b2          b3          b4              b5
# moon phase: new, first quarter, full, third quarter, waning crescent
#               c1      c2          c3      c4              c5
# amount: a bit, some, standard, a lot, pile
#           d1      d2      d3      d4    d5

# clues
# (1) mandrake root was collected in a standard amount in the third quarter.
# (2) rosemary was collected on a new moon in the maximum possible amount, but not by domingo.
# (3) antonius and horacio were working on either a full moon or the third quarter.
# (4) the juniper berries were collected on the moon's first quarter.
# (5) no one was collecting mistletoe on the two last phases of the moon.
# (6) horacio harvested the smallest possible amount of herbs on a full moon.
# (7) three herbalists - the one who collected only some herbs, another who collected mandrake root,
#     and flavian - were working on first and third quarters of the moon, and also on the waning crescent.

# abstraction
# quality A: a1, ..., a5 -> names
# quality B: b1, ..., b5 -> herbs
# quality C: c1, ..., c5 -> moon phase
# quality D: d1, ..., d5 -> amount

# what the clues mean
# (1) b1 & d3 & c4
# (2) (b3 & c1 & d5) !& a2
# (3) (a1 & c3, a4 & c4) or (a1 & c4, a4 & c3)  //  (a1, a4) &? (c3, c4)
# (4) b4 & c2
# (5) b5 !& c4, b5 !& c5
# (6) a4 & d1 & c3
# (7) (d2, b1, a3) &? (c2, c4, c5)

# clue abstraction notation
# A & B : A belongs to B = B belongs to A
# A !& B : A and B do not belong together
# (A, B) &? (C, D) : A and B belong to C and D, but the exact relations are unknown, short for (A & C, B & D) or (A & D, B & C), from this it follows that A !& B, C !& D

# Additional notation for puzzles with an ordered quality
# A < B : A is directly left of B
# A > B : A is directly right of B
# A << B : A is left of B, but not necessarily right next to B
# A >> B : A is right of B, but not necessarily right next to B
# A <?> B : A and B are directly next to each other
